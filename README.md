# Survivor Clone - Crappy Edition
## What is this?
A simple little survivor clone while I'm learning Godot. You have a few weapon options, simply survive for 5 minutes. There are three starting characters to pick from, each hero comes with a unique weapon. You upgrade weapons and skills by collecting experience gems, these drop when you kill monsters.

You don't actively shoot, spells and skills auto trigger, all you need to do is run around and survive!

I'll be updating this game every so often and will be adding more heroes, weapons, monsters and levels!
